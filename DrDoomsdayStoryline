The Enchanted Woods District (I couldn't think of any better puns)

//Doddy goes through the forest until he finds a 3D platform. Terrible music plays and Dr. Doomsday swoops down from above.

DD: Ah, we meet again, Doddy! I see you've discovered my devious idea!
Don't you like it? It was delightfully converted from it's original form using my diabolical DIMENSION INVENTION! //animation and music plays
Why? Don't you see, you dense dimwit? 3D movies make MONEY!
I mean, look at those 3D effects! //full platform animation plays
Soon all of the Cinematic Universe will be converted, and all of the civilians bones will be crushed and painfully distorted, in the name of artistic progress! 
And there's nothing you can do to stop me. That platform is far too high for you to jump!
So long, you daft hero! HAHAHA! //animation and music plays and he flies away

//Tutorial text shows the player how to rotate the block
//At the end of the level, the player finds a note

NOTE: So, you did manage to get past the jump... 
So be it. But the Dimension Invention has already started to work it's magic here, and I am long gone, without a trace!
So unless you're lookin' to lose your head, you best stay away, partner!
Go ahead. Make my day.

But Doddy knew exactly where Dr. Doomsday had gone!


The Eastwood Desert District

//halfway through the level, Dr. Doomsday sweeps in
DD: How did you find me? You dispicible devil!
No matter! You're far too late now! My Dimension Invention is already done with it's duty!
HAHAHAHAHA! //flies away with animation and music

//At the end of the level, player finds a note

NOTE: So you've managed to find me, but you will never catch me again! I am already far, far away!
You cannot stop the change, any more than you can stop the suns from setting!
Now, young Skywalker, you will die!
... Ooops. 


The Deep Dark District

//at the end of the level, the player finds Dr. Doomsday turned around, working on the Dimension Invention

DD: No! Uh...
Pay no attention to that big red button!
Don't you dare push that button!
No! NO! DON'T!
//Doddy pushes the button
NOOOOOOOO!
//the invention explodes, all the stuff turns 2D, triumphant music plays
You may have defeated my idea this day, Doddy, but I'll decimate you next time!
//flies away
THERE'S ALWAYS A SEQUEL!

//YOU WIN
